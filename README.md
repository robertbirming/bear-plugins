# Bear plugins

Small JavaScript helpers for Bear Blog.

These scripts are designed to be dropped in and blend naturally with Bear.

## Blog

### Archive toolkit

Utilities for the Bear post archive listing. Inspired by the great work of [Herman](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bear-plugins) and
[Mighil’s post sorting script](https://mighil.com/script-to-sort-posts-by-month-on-bear-blog).

<a href="archive-toolkit.js">Code</a>

Embed:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/robertbirming/bear-plugins/archive-toolkit.js"></script>
```

### Date formatter

A small utility for formatting `<time datetime="...">` elements on Bear sites.  
Keeps dates consistent across the site, and works nicely with the Bearming archive toolkit by showing day-only dates in the archive list.

<a href="date-format.js">Code</a>

Embed:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/robertbirming/bear-plugins/date-format.js"></script>

```

### Copy button

Adds a simple code copy button for the [Bearming theme](https://robertbirming.com/bearming/).

Embed:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/robertbirming/bear-plugins/copy-button.js"></script>
```

## Dashboard

### Dashboard notes

A small notes panel inside the Bear dashboard, useful for reminders, ideas, or things you don’t want to forget.

<a href="dashboard-notes.js">Code</a>

Embed:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/robertbirming/bear-plugins/dashboard-notes.js"></script>
```

These scripts are provided as-is. Feel free to use or adapt them.
