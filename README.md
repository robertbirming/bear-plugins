# Bear plugins

Small JavaScript helpers for Bear Blog.

These scripts are designed to be dropped in as-is and blend naturally with Bear.

## Blog

### Archive toolkit

Utilities for the Bear post archive listing. Inspired by the great work of [Herman](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bear-plugins) and
[Mighil’s post sorting script](https://mighil.com/script-to-sort-posts-by-month-on-bear-blog).

```

## Dashboard

### Dashboard notes

A small notes panel inside the Bear dashboard, useful for reminders, ideas, or things you don’t want to forget.

```

These scripts are provided as-is. Feel free to use or adapt them.

Part of my ongoing work with Bear and the [Bearming theme](https://robertbirming.com/bearming/).
